                <h1><em>What are the problems we found?</em></h1>
                <hr>
                <p>Schools face several operational challenges that impact safety, efficiency, and convenience. Managing visitors without a structured system can lead to long wait times, security risks, and difficulty tracking who is on campus. Similarly, traditional lost-and-found processes are often inefficient, making it time-consuming for students to recover misplaced items. These outdated methods hinder the smooth functioning of campus operations.</p>
                <p>Another critical issue is the reliance on manual or outdated systems for student identification, which can result in delays, inaccuracies, and security vulnerabilities. Lost or damaged IDs, for example, create challenges in verifying student identity and granting access to facilities. Together, these problems highlight the need for modern, technology-driven solutions to improve security, organization, and overall campus efficiency.</p>

                            <p>It is an appointment-based school entry system that streamlines the process using an efficient digital solution. This system enables schools to pre-schedule, approve, and manage visitor appointments securely, reducing administrative delays and ensuring a smoother, faster, and more organized check-in process for visitors.</p>
                            <h3><strong>Problem:</strong></h3>
                            <p>Our school struggles with keeping track of visitors. Without an organized system, it is difficult to manage entry into the school, and tracking who is in the building can be challenging. The manual process of issuing visitor passes is often slow and prone to errors.</p>

                        <h3><strong>Solution:</strong></h3>
                        <p>
                        1. Visitors can sign up online before they arrive, entering their details and visit time.<br>
                        2. A digital pass (QR code) is sent to the visitor's phone or email, or it can be accessed at the kiosk for a quick check-in.<br>
                        3. The system can send an instant message to the host, letting them know their visitor has arrived.<br>                            4. The system speeds up the process by allowing visitors to check in quickly and reducing the need for staff involvement.<br>
                        5. Visitors can pre-register online, receive a digital pass, and quickly check in upon arrival. A self-service kiosk at the entrance allows visitors to easily retrieve their pass by scanning an ID or entering their details, either printing a visitor card or sending a digital pass.

                            <h2>ID VeriMatch</h2>
                            <p>This system is a facial recognition-based ID scanner developed to enhance security and streamline identity verification for students. It operates by analyzing and matching a student's facial features with the photo stored on their university ID. Additionally, it cross-checks the ID number with the university's official enrollment database to confirm the student's active status. This dual-layer verification ensures accurate identification, minimizes unauthorized access, and improves overall campus management efficiency.</p>
                            <h3><strong>Problem:</strong></h3>
                            <p>Many schools use regular student ID cards for things like entering buildings or checking into events. However, these cards can get lost, damaged, or be easily copied, making it hard to identify students correctly. This can cause delays and confusion when students try to access places or get services, and the manual checking process can be slow and sometimes inaccurate.</p>

                    <p>
                            1. Students can quickly be identified without long waits or manual checks.<br>
                            2. The system automatically keeps track of who is where and when, so there are fewer mistakes.<br>
                            3. Students can use their phones or cards to quickly enter buildings or access resources, without worrying about losing or damaging their IDs.<br>
                            4. This new system makes everything faster, safer, and easier for both students and school staff.
